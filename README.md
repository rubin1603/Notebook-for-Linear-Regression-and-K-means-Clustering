# Notebooks-for-Linear-Regression-K-means-Clustering
Open with google colab or Jupyter Notebook.

This notebook contains a proper code for implementing Linear Regression and K-means clustering algorithms.
Finding out appropriate 'k-value' is also implemented using elbow curve.
All the description about the dataset is given in the notebook where seed number is the last two digits of your roll number in your university (from 01 to 100).
